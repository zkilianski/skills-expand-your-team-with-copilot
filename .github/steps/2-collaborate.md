## Step 2: Collaborate with Copilot

When Copilot creates a pull request in which you'll find:

- **Pull Request Description** - Copilot will keep a concise overview of its goal and implementation.
- **Timeline** - Copilot will provide high-level notes about starting working sessions and commits.
- **Session History** - A detailed log of the steps Copilot took to implement the issue.

You can provide feedback to Copilot the same way you would a colleague. These actions trigger Copilot to begin another working session.

- **Comments** - Add a comment on the pull request conversation.
- **Reviews** - Combine multiple comments in a pull request review.
- **@ mentions** - You can tag Copilot in a comment just like a coworker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot only acts on review comments when explicitly tagged with `@copilot`. Without this mention, your review feedback will not trigger Copilot to respond or make changes. 

#### Important Considerations

- Copilot's work is done on a branch with the convention `copilot/*` and does not have access to other branches.
- Copilot cannot trigger Actions workflows.
  - Workflows triggered on pull requests require human approval before running.
- Rulesets and similar protections are still enforced.

> [!TIP]
> All work created by Copilot is committed with the assignee as a co-contributor (keeping your contribution graph safe). üíï
