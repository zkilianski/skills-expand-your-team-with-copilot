# Calendar view

The current card view is useful, but a calendar view would make it much easier to view overlap and duplicate registrations for the same timeslot.

### Recommendation

- Add a view toggle in the top bar that allows switching between card view and calendar view.
- The calendar view is just 1 week. Sunday - Saturday going left to right and time going top to bottom.
- The activity entries should visually line up with their times. They aren't just a list of items on each day.
- If multiple items should appear at the same time, reduce their width and show them next to each other.

- If necessary, it is ok to just put the activity name and current enrollment on the calendar. When they hover over the entry, it shows the full details.
