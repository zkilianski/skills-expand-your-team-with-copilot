# Simplify change requests for teachers

Teachers are not comfortable modifying program directly. They are also unsure what to put in the issues to explain what they need.

### Recommendation

Make a series of issue template forms for common tasks. Make sure enough details are required so Copilot coding agent can easily be assigned these tasks without further explanation.

### Context

A well defined issue typically includes these items (at a minimum).

- Clear problem description
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Hints, tips, and suggested solutions to get started.
- Limitations, related information, and other context.
