# How to Request Changes for Teachers

This guide explains how to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities website without needing to modify code yourself.

## Overview

We've created simple forms that guide you through requesting changes. Just fill out the form that matches what you need, and the development team (or Copilot coding agent) will handle the technical implementation.

## Creating a New Request

1. Go to the [Issues page](../../issues)
2. Click the green **"New issue"** button
3. Choose the template that matches your need
4. Fill out the form
5. Click **"Submit new issue"**

That's it! Your request will be reviewed and assigned for implementation.

## Which Template Should I Use?

### üé® UI Enhancement Request
**Use this when:** You want to change how the website looks or feels

**Examples:**
- Change the website colors to match school colors
- Add a mascot or logo to the page
- Make buttons bigger or change their position
- Adjust text sizes or fonts
- Change the layout of activity cards

### ‚ú® Feature Request
**Use this when:** You want to add new functionality

**Examples:**

- Add a search box to find activities by name

### üêõ Bug Report
**Use this when:** Something is broken or not working correctly

**Examples:**

### üìù Content/Data Change Request

## Tips for Writing Good Requests

### Be Specific
‚ùå Bad: "The website looks bad"
‚úÖ Good: "Change the header background from blue to white and the text from white to lime green (#00FF00)"

### Explain the "Why"
Help us understand the reason for your request:
- "Students are confused about which activities match their skill level"
- "Our school colors are white and lime green, not blue"
- "Students want to see all activities for a specific day at once"

### Provide Examples When Possible
- Link to similar designs you like
- Provide color codes (like #00FF00 for lime green)
- Reference specific activities or examples from the current site

### Include All Details
If adding a new activity, include:
- Activity name
- Description
- Days it meets
- Start and end times
- Maximum number of participants
- Category (sports, arts, academic, community, technology)

## What Happens Next?

1. **Your request is received** - It appears as a new issue
2. **Review** - The team reviews your request
3. **Assignment** - The issue is assigned to a developer or Copilot agent
4. **Implementation** - The changes are made and tested
5. **Notification** - You'll be notified when it's complete

You can track progress by viewing the issue you created. You'll receive email updates when there are comments or status changes.

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does it take to implement a request?**
A: Simple changes (like updating content) can be done quickly. Complex features may take longer. Mark your priority level to help us understand urgency.

**Q: Can I request multiple changes at once?**
A: It's better to create separate issues for different changes. This makes it easier to track and implement each one.

**Q: What if I don't know all the technical details?**
A: That's okay! Fill out what you know and explain what you want to achieve. The development team will ask questions if they need more information.

**Q: Can I see examples of previous requests?**
A: Yes! Browse the [closed issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to see how others have requested changes.
